# Exp 6: Design an IoT based fan speed control circuit using Altium software and generate the Gerber file.

# AIM:
To design the schematic and PCB layout diagram of an IoT based fan speed control circuit using Altium software.
# EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
●	Hardware: Personal Computer (PC)<br>
●	Software: Altium  <br>
# PROCEDURE:
Open Your PCB Project<br>
	Launch Altium Designer.<br>
	Open your completed PCB design project (.PrjPcb).<br>
	Ensure your PCB layout is finalized, with correct layers, footprints, and clearances.<br>
Check Design Rules and Electrical Rules<br>
	Go to Tools > Design Rule Check (DRC).<br>
	Run checks for clearance, short circuits, and net connectivity.<br>
	Fix any errors before generating outputs.<br>
Open the Output Job File (Optional)<br>
	Go to File > New > Output Job File to create an .OutJob file.<br>
	Add Gerber Files, NC Drill Files, and other manufacturing outputs as needed.<br>
Generate Gerber Files<br>
	Go to File > Fabrication Outputs > Gerber Files.<br>
	In the Gerber Setup window, configure:<br>
o	Units (mm or inch)<br>
o	Format (usually 4:4 or 2:5)<br>
o	Layers to Plot: Select top layer, bottom layer, solder mask layers, silkscreen layers, etc.<br>
o	Set Aperture and Plot Options (mirror, include pad holes, etc.)<br>
Generate NC Drill Files<br>
	Go to File > Fabrication Outputs > NC Drill Files.<br>
	Configure settings like units, format, and which holes to include.<br>
	Click OK to generate the drill files.<br>
Preview Gerber Files<br>
	Use CAMtastic or any Gerber viewer (Altium has one built-in) to preview the files.<br>
	Go to File > Import > Gerber, and inspect the output visually.<br>
 Export Files<br>
	All generated files will be saved in the Project Outputs folder.<br>
	Zip all relevant files (Gerbers, NC Drill, ReadMe, Fab notes) and send to the manufacturer.<br>

# THEORY:
The project titled "IoT Based Smart Fan Control using ESP8266 and Blynk" demonstrates an innovative approach to home automation by enabling users to control the speed of a conventional fan over the internet. Unlike typical IoT projects that offer simple on/off control, this design incorporates a TRIAC-based circuit to adjust the fan's speed remotely. The system utilizes the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for connectivity and leverages the Blynk mobile application to provide a user-friendly interface for control. The compact design of the circuit allows for easy installation, making it a practical solution for modernizing existing home appliances without extensive modifications.
The hardware setup includes essential components such as the ESP8266 microcontroller, TRIAC for controlling AC power, opto-isolators for safety, and various resistors and capacitors to ensure stable operation. The circuit is designed to handle appliances up to 250 watts, making it suitable for standard ceiling fans. A buzzer is integrated into the system to provide audible feedback during operation, enhancing user interaction. The project also emphasizes safety and reliability, with components selected to handle the electrical demands of controlling AC-powered devices. The use of PCBWay for fabricating the circuit board ensures a professional and compact layout, contributing to the overall efficiency and aesthetics of the device.
On the software side, the Blynk platform offers a customizable interface where users can adjust fan speed through virtual sliders or buttons on their smartphones. The ESP8266 communicates with the Blynk server over Wi-Fi, receiving commands and adjusting the fan's speed accordingly by modulating the TRIAC's firing angle. This integration of hardware and software showcases the potential of IoT in enhancing everyday appliances, providing convenience and energy efficiency. The project serves as an excellent example for enthusiasts and professionals interested in developing smart home solutions, illustrating the practical application of IoT technologies in improving comfort and control within residential environments.
